career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Creative and curious, I like theoretical and practical computer science.
    I'm interested in strongly typed programming languages which use logic or
    functional programming paradigms.

      details:
        Research in type theory through logic programming aiming to propose a
        versatile type-class solver for the Coq proof assistant.

experiences:
  title: Experiences
  info:
    - role: Internship in type theory
      time: 2023/03/01 $\rightarrow$ 2023/08/31
      company: INRIA, Sophia Antipolis
      details: |
        The goal of the internship is to elaborate a new type-class solver for
        the proof assistant Coq. The solver will be written in Elpi, a logic
        programming language derived from Prolog with binders and constraints
        which, thanks to the Coq-Elpi library can be easily plugged in the
        Coq's interpreter to build new tactics and commands. This
        implementation aims to provide a more readable, high- customizable and
        user-friendly type-class solver focused on high time performances. The
        new solver will be tested on existing and largely used libraries in
        the coq world such as stdpp and iris.
    - role: Internship in language theory
      time: 2022/06/01 $\rightarrow$ 2022/08/31
      company: i3s, Sophia Antipolis
      details: |
        Active learning with automata is a branch of language theory in which
        the user (learner) is capable of reconstructing the grammar G of a
        language via direct communication with a so-called teacher who knows
        G. This framework was introduced by Dana Angluin in 1987, where the
        learner can send to the teacher membership and equivalence queries to
        learn a regular grammar (this algorithm is called L*). The goal of
        this internship is to use this learning framework to learn more
        powerful grammars, in particular the visibly context- free one. An
        example of a grammar of this kind is represented by the XML
        metalanguage. You can find an implementation of mine of some the
        active learning algorithms I have studied
        [here](https://fissored.github.io/Learning-And-More?Home): (used
        technologies and frameworks: React, Redux, Bootstrap in Typescript via
        NodeJs)
